object Test with
  fun bar = 1
  fun foo() = bar + 1

let f = Test.foo
//│ f = [Function: foo]

:re
f()
//│ ═══[RUNTIME ERROR] TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bar')


// * TODO we should probably compile the above as:

object Test with
  fun bar = 1
  fun foo() = Test.bar + 1

let f = Test.foo
//│ f = [Function: foo]

f()
//│ = 2


// * Which also works well no matter where the object is defined:

fun test() =
  object Test with
    fun bar = 1
    fun foo() = Test.bar + 1
  [Test]

let f = test().0.foo
//│ f = [Function: foo]

f()
//│ = 2


// * However, it would disable open recursion upon object inheritance (eg `class C extends Test with ...`).
// * But it would be better to require open recursion to be explicitly indicated by `virtual` anyway.
